To run the project, first you need to deploy the tomcat as local server. We use tomcat 9.0.45 inside IDEA compiler as the server. And before running the system, you need to create the database. The SQL file is inside the project.


## Usage

When the normal student upload their health information and get approved from administrator, they can sign up/out for activities. Additionally, they can check the location by using Google map. After signing in, the administrator can pass or ban the status of normal students.
